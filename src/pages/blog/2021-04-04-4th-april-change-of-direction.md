Due to technical limitations and the time span available to create my website I had to edit the concept of it.

Instead of a website that provides a platform to buy and sell clothing for everyone, it is now a store for a group of designers who hand-make unique designs from recycled clothing and materials.

This means the general idea of the store is exactly the same, however, it no longer will have an option to sell.

Having to change the concept so late has been detrimental to the product, as I no longer have adequate time to thoroughly plan out the UX design, and iron out the fine details.
