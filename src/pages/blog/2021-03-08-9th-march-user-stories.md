**User 1 -** *Pam*

Pam visits the website and creates an account. She navigates her way to the 'Buy' section of the website and begins to browse, scrolling through the numerous listings. She sets up some filters to try and pinpont what she is looking for, and when she finds what she wants, she adds them to her cart.

When she's finished browsing she decides to purchase what she's found. She contacts the sellers to arrange shipping and cost. A few days later her package arrives and she repairs and stylises the items she brought.

**User 2 -** *Lanie*

After a clean-out of her wardrobe, Lanie discovers that she has a lot of old and slightly ruined clothes which she'd find hard to sell on. She signs up for Renoo and navigates to the sell section. Here she fills out a form which asks for photos of the clothing, the damage, asking price etc. Once she is finished with this she clicks post listing.

After a few days she checks the listings and sees that some people have contacted her regarding purchase. She negotiates the final price and shipping, then ships the items and receives her payment.

**User 3 -** *Designer*

The designer logs into their account and firstly checks all their listings. This is an everyday thing, as they create a lot of material off cuts which are put to good use, and even turn a slight profit when sold on Renoo. They then update their listings to include the offcuts they produced today, and returned the messages to potential buyers.
